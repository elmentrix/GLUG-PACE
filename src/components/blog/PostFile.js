                "body": "<p>Git is a version-control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source-code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision-control system, it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. There are multiple Version Control Systems, but Git is by far and large the most popularâ€Šboth for individual and company use.</p>" +
                        "<p>Git was created by Linus TorvaldsðŸ˜‡ in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.</p>" +
                        "<p>Version control is the only reasonable way to keep track of changes in code, manuscripts, presentations, and data analysis projects. I used to make numbered tar.gz files for a project. But exploring the differences is difficult, to say the least. And if you use git properly, youâ€™ll have annotated each small change. Unless you can write something perfectly the first time, you need to have a version control system ðŸ˜œ.</p>" +
                        "<h3>Git repositories</h3>" + 
                        "<p>A Git repository contains the history of a collection of files starting from a certain directory. The process of copying an existing Git repository via the Git tooling is called cloning. After cloning a repository the user has the complete repository with its history on his/her local machine. Of course, Git also supports the creation of new repositories.</p>" +
                        "<h3>The concept of branches</h3>" +
                        "<p>Git supports branching which means that you can work on different versions of your collection of files. A branch allows the user to switch between these versions so that he can work on different changes independently from each other.</p>" +
                        "<p>For example, if you want to develop a new feature, you can create a branch and make the changes in this branch. This does not affect the state of your files in other branches. For example, you can work independently on a branch called production for bugfixes and on another branch called new_feature for implementing a new feature.</p>" +
                        "<p>Ok, I think it's more than enough for you to understand What <b>Git</b> is. Hereâ€™s an awesome (free!) interactive tutorial sponsored by GitHub where you can learn all of the basics: <a href=\"https://try.github.io/\" target=\"blank\">try.github.io</a></p>" +
                        "<p>Also participate in our event on Git & GitHub 101 to know more about Git and it's uses ðŸ˜ƒ. Check out the details <a href=\"https://elmentrix.github.io/glugpace/events/1/\">here</a></p>",
